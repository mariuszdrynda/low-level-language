# low-level-language
Low Level Language is an intermediate representation for C programming language

# Goal

Goal is to create as simple as possible programming language that could serve as intermediate representation for other, higher level function. This is a way to demonstrate that all (or almost all) of languages features could be replaced by simple, but powerfull mechanisms.

Second, and more impotant, is to study different possibilities of optimization and safety

# Principal rules

+ Only one file as code input
+ No infix operators (only functions)
+ No hidden control flow (a program does only what we intended and nothing more)

This rules could change as language will evolve.
